# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to identify the number of employees who will be reaching retirement age and identify which employees are elegible to participate in a mentorship program. The information about to be presented should give Pewlett-Hackard a good understanding of what the company is about to face in the coming years. As people begin to retire, we have to face the fact that the man power may not be available to replace all those individuals leaving a vacant position.

## Results

 - There are 1,549 employees that are elegible for the mentorship program.
 - Out of the 443,308 employees Pewlett-Hackard has, 7.47 % of them are retiring within a couple of years.

Considering that the Engineer postion is critical for a company like Pewlett-Hackard, we have to focus on figuring out how to maximize the time of those Engineers available for mentoring as they represent the 27.82 % of those elegible to do so. If we can have them start training he next generation now, it will make the trasition process more manageable.

If we manage our current staff and their time properly, we can conclude that we have enough staff to coach and mentor. The selected employees will have the oportunity to grow within the company as positions become available having the experience and expertise on what the company needs to remain successful.
